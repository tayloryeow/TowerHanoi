# Towers of Hanoi 


## What is this?

>An introductory programming puzzle from the year 1883 invented by a French Poly math

The basic idea is that you have a number of pillars and a number of discs. 

Each disc is a unique size. Additionally each disc rests on a pillar. 

Each disc must rest on a disc that is larger in size than it. 
>(Technically put: Going down the pillar every disc must be MONITONICALLY increasing in size)

Moving only one disc at time write a "alogirthm" or series of steps that will put all the discs in the correct order on a single pillar!

## Problem Setup
---

### The rules

#### Disc Movement Rules
1. Only one disc can be moved a time.
2. A disc must rest on a disc that is larger than it or an empty pillar.
3. A disc can only move from one pillar to another.

#### Victory Condition

1. All Discs are on a single pillar in a valid configuration.

### Problem Description
#### This explains how we represent the problem in the computer mathmatically.

## Levels of the Problem

There are three levels of this problem. 
Each level gets progressivly more complex in conception. 

Finish whatever you can.

You will have a very easy time on level 0. 
The actual problems in level 1 that's where the meat of the problem is. 
Level 2 is very difficult and if anyone gets it I will be immpressed.

0. Play the simplest version of the game. TODO
1. Write an alogirthm for the simplest complex case of the 3 pillar problem.
2. Extend your algorithmn or just test the same code alogrithmn from level 1 onto level 2.
